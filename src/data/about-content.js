  story: `Got my first Sinclair ZX81 in 1986. Discovered techno beats and the underground scene in 1991. Started using the internet in 1996, began coding in 1998, deep in the warez scene. Built top lists when 468x60 banners were the thing and IRC was our hub:

/join #warez-elite @find matrix.reloaded !list for complete release list /msg CoolBot xdcc send #42

That's what connected us.

2000, I discovered mystical systems, lucid dreaming techniques. 2002, I registered a business for an internet agency and online trading on eBay. Financial success didn't come, so in 2008 I went back to a regular job, including 12-hour shifts, day and night. 2016, I discovered Merch by Amazon. Spent two years uploading 16k designs. Years later, I had meaningful passive income. Meanwhile, I dove into crypto and blockchain. This period until late 2022 was all about trying and failing.

I never recognized my own value. Always thought what I knew, everyone else knew too. Never saw myself as a nerd. Had zero interest in money because I would've sold my freedom for it. Curiosity and freedom mattered more. But it all had to happen this way – that was my path.

2023 gave me the chance to find clarity, to really get clear with myself. I discovered Human Design. And through that, I discovered myself. Despite setbacks, I never hit rock bottom – just landed on higher plateaus and kept going. I had time, no daily grind, no social obligations. Got certified as a holistic health coach. Bought tools, courses, licenses. And through joy and curiosity, I got one step closer to clarity every single day.

It brought me back to my roots, where it all started. HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Now I'm building JAMstack websites & LLMO - Large Language Model Optimization. I'm building privacy-first AI infrastructure on self-hosted servers, creating tools for coaches and consultants who value digital sovereignty. Solid technology, backed by 29 years of curiosity and internet experience.`
