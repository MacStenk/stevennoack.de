Got my first **Sinclair ZX81** in 1986. Discovered techno beats and the underground scene in 1991. Started using the internet in 1996, began coding in 1998, deep in the warez scene. Built top lists when 468x60 banners were the thing and IRC was our hub:

```
> /join #warez-elite @find  matrix.reloaded
> !list for complete  release list
> /msg CoolBot xdcc send #42
```

> That's what connected us.

Now building with **JAMstack**, **Docker**, **Astro**, **n8n** -creating composable AI infrastructure for privacy-conscious professionals.

**29 years** in the internet business. Still learning. Still building. Still loving the code.
